Great choice! Let’s break down how we can get started on the Football Match Predictor app. Here’s a high-level roadmap:
Key Features to Include:

1. Match Predictor Form
A simple form where users can input team names, choose a match date, and predict scores.

2. Prediction History
Display a list of past predictions, along with the actual scores (if available). This will let users track their prediction accuracy.

3. Leaderboard or Accuracy Score
Optionally, you could include a leaderboard feature or track each user’s prediction accuracy to add a competitive edge.

4. Real-Time Data Integration (Optional)
If you're interested, we could integrate a football API to pull in actual match results, team data, or live updates.

From here, we could explore adding more features, like:

Editing or Deleting Predictions: Allow users to modify or remove a prediction.
Leaderboard: Track prediction accuracy over time.
API Integration: If you’d like real match data, we could pull from a football data API.
